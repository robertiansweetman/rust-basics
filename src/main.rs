fn main() {
    let mut name = "Rob"; //Rust non owned String type, immutable by default. If you want to own the memory i.e. need to return a String from a function then use String instead.
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    name = "Bill";              // if you don't make 'name' mutable then you can't re-assign it to something else later
                                // In fact the vscode editor will actually point this out - probably Rust Analyzer doing this!
